# PHP_lab

Students! please use this online IDE for testing your php code download and set up local environment: [One Compiler](https://onecompiler.com/php/)

Introduce students to the core concepts and functionalities of PHP in a hands-on manner. Below are five lab exercises that gradually increase in complexity and cover a range of basic PHP topics, including syntax, variables, control structures, functions, and basic form handling. These exercises are intended for beginners and aim to provide a practical understanding of PHP.

### Lab 1: Hello, World!

**Objective:** Familiarize students with PHP syntax and setting up a PHP file.

**Task:**
1. Create a PHP file named `hello.php`.
2. Write PHP code that outputs "Hello, World!" to the browser.

**Expected Outcome:** When the `hello.php` file is accessed in a browser, it displays "Hello, World!".

### Lab 2: Working with Variables

**Objective:** Learn to declare and use variables in PHP.

**Task:**
1. Create a PHP file named `variables.php`.
2. Declare two variables, one for your name and another for your age.
3. Echo a sentence that includes both variables, e.g., "My name is John, and I am 30 years old."

**Expected Outcome:** The browser displays a sentence incorporating the values stored in the variables.

### Lab 3: Control Structures - If-Else and Loops

**Objective:** Understand how to use if-else statements and loops in PHP.

**Task:**
1. Create a PHP file named `control-structures.php`.
2. Use an if-else statement to check if a number is positive or negative.
3. Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

**Expected Outcome:** The script correctly identifies a number as positive or negative and prints numbers from 1 to 10.

### Lab 4: PHP Functions

**Objective:** Learn how to create and use functions in PHP.

**Task:**
1. Create a PHP file named `functions.php`.
2. Write a function that takes a name as an argument and returns a greeting, e.g., "Hello, [name]!".
3. Call the function with a few different names and echo the results.

**Expected Outcome:** The script outputs a personalized greeting for each name provided to the function.

### Lab 5: Basic Form Handling

**Objective:** Introduce basic form handling with PHP.

**Task:**
1. Create an HTML file with a simple form that includes fields for a user's name and age.
2. Create a PHP file named `form-handler.php` that processes the form data.
3. Use the `POST` method for the form, and ensure the PHP script displays the submitted name and age.

**Expected Outcome:** When the form is submitted, `form-handler.php` displays the user's name and age.

**Additional Notes for Instructors:**
- Ensure students have access to a server environment where they can run PHP scripts (e.g., local development environment like XAMPP, WAMP, or a live server).
- Encourage students to experiment with the code by modifying the examples and observing how changes affect the output.
- Provide support materials on PHP syntax, functions, and form handling for students to reference during their labs.

These labs provide a foundation for students to build upon as they progress to more advanced PHP programming concepts and techniques.
